This is a _playground_ repository for early experimentation with the [Tonic](https://github.com/hyperium/tonic)/[PROST](https://github.com/tokio-rs/prost) stack. 

The workspace contains a single _submodule_ which defines protocol buffers for a `TasksServer`. The `TasksServer` is implemented in TypeScript.

The [_greeter_](https://github.com/phasewalk1/tonic-prost-playground/tree/main/greeter) directory contains relevant _Tonic_/_Prost_ code which defines a second gRPC service, the `Greeter`. A novel connection is made between the Rust and TypeScript server within [server.rs](https://github.com/phasewalk1/tonic-prost-playground/blob/main/greeter/src/server.rs),
specifically, the asynchronous function `say_hello` - the defintion of `Greeter`'s RPC method. 


## Run Locally
I'd like to note that the execution flow of this is not necessarily interesting or dynamic at all - it is simply meant to be a "let's try and hook two services up" example for learning. 

First, let's install the `npm` dependencies for the TypeScript `Tasks` service.
```sh
cd tasks/ && npm i
```
We can now start the `TasksServer` by
```sh
npm run serverstart
```
Now that we have a running `TasksServer`, let's try and hook our `Greeter` up. We'll first move into the `greeter/` directory
```sh
cd ../greeter
```
(assuming you were still in `/tasks`), and then, we'll run the `GreeterServer`
```sh
cargo serve
```
This is an alias provided in [config.toml](https://github.com/phasewalk1/tonic-prost-playground/blob/main/greeter/.cargo/config.toml) to quickly build and run our server code. We should now have two independent services running, a `TasksServer` and a `GreeterServer`. Let's use our `GreeterClient` to talk to our `GreeterServer` now,
```sh
cargo client
```
This is another alias provided that begins the main execution flow of this example. Here, we run a `GreeterClient` instance that calls an RPC method at the `GreeterServer`.
The `GreeterServer` then instantiates a `TasksClient` and uses it to make an RPC call at the `TasksServer`, bundling its return value into its own and returning the bundle to the `GreeterClient`.
